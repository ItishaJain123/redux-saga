<p>
  Both Redux Saga and Redux Thunk are middleware used to handle asynchronous
  logic in Redux applications.
</p>

<p>
  The difference is not about which one is better, but about
  <strong>which problem size</strong> they are designed for.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Redux Thunk</h2>

<p>
  Redux Thunk allows action creators to return functions instead of plain
  objects.
</p>

<p>
  This makes it easy to write async logic like API calls directly inside
  actions.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>simple to learn</li>
  <li>minimal setup</li>
  <li>good for small applications</li>
</ul>

<p>However, as the app grows, Thunks can become:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deeply nested</li>
  <li>hard to cancel</li>
  <li>difficult to test</li>
  <li>tightly coupled to Redux dispatch</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Redux Saga</h2>

<p>Redux Saga uses generator functions to describe async flows step by step.</p>

<p>
  Instead of executing side effects immediately, Sagas
  <strong>describe</strong> what should happen.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear control over execution flow</li>
  <li>built-in cancellation support</li>
  <li>better handling of complex scenarios</li>
  <li>highly testable logic</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes Saga more suitable for large and long-running applications.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Key differences</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Thunk is promise-based, Saga is generator-based</li>
  <li>Thunk executes logic immediately, Saga controls execution</li>
  <li>Thunk scales poorly with complexity, Saga scales well</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to use what</h2>

<p>Use <strong>Redux Thunk</strong> when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the app is small</li>
  <li>async logic is minimal</li>
</ul>

<p>Use <strong>Redux Saga</strong> when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>async flows are complex</li>
  <li>cancellation and retries matter</li>
  <li>business logic must stay outside components</li>
</ul>
