    <h1>What is Redux Saga?</h1>

    <p>
      Redux Saga is a library used with Redux to handle
      <strong>side effects</strong>
      in a predictable and manageable way.
    </p>

    <p>
      In simple terms, Redux Saga helps you manage things that happen
      <strong>outside the Redux store</strong>, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>API calls</li>
      <li>delays and timers</li>
      <li>background tasks</li>
      <li>data fetching and syncing</li>
      <li>cancelling ongoing operations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The core idea</h2>

    <p>
      Redux Saga works by running special JavaScript functions called
      <strong>generator functions</strong> in the background.
    </p>

    <p>These generator functions listen for Redux actions and decide:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>what async work to perform</li>
      <li>when to perform it</li>
      <li>what to do on success or failure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instead of writing async logic inside components or action creators, Redux
      Saga moves that logic into a <strong>separate layer</strong>.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Where Redux Saga fits</h2>

    <p>Redux Saga sits between:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the action being dispatched</li>
      <li>and the reducer updating the store</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It acts as a <strong>middleware</strong> that intercepts actions, performs
      side effects, and then dispatches new actions based on results.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Key takeaway</h2>

    <p>
      Redux Saga does not replace Redux. It <strong>enhances Redux</strong> by
      keeping reducers pure and moving complex async logic into an organized,
      testable flow.
