<h1>Redux Saga Effects</h1>

<p>
  Redux Saga effects are instructions that a saga gives to the Redux-Saga
  middleware. The saga itself does not execute async code. Instead, it describes
  what should happen, and Redux-Saga takes care of executing it.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>call</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>call</strong> effect is used when you want to run a function and
  wait for its result. This is most commonly used for API calls. When a saga
  yields a call effect, it pauses until the function finishes and then continues
  with the returned data.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> const data = yield call(fetchUsersApi); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>put</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>put</strong> effect is used to dispatch an action to the Redux
  store. It works like <code>dispatch</code>, but it is controlled by Redux
  Saga. Reducers handle the action and update the state as usual.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> yield put({ type: "FETCH_SUCCESS", payload: data }); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>take</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>take</strong> effect pauses the saga until a specific action is
  dispatched. Once the action is received, the saga continues execution. It
  listens only once and then stops.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> yield take("LOGIN"); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>takeEvery</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>takeEvery</strong> effect listens for an action and runs a worker
  saga every time that action is dispatched. It does not cancel any previous
  task. Multiple worker sagas can run at the same time.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> yield takeEvery("FETCH_USERS", fetchUsersWorker); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>takeLatest</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>takeLatest</strong> effect is similar to takeEvery, but it cancels
  the previous running task and keeps only the latest one. This is very useful
  for search boxes, filters, and fast user interactions.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> yield takeLatest("SEARCH_USERS", searchUsersWorker); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>fork</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>fork</strong> effect starts a task in the background. The saga
  does not wait for it to finish and continues execution immediately. This is
  used for background processes like polling or syncing.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> const task = yield fork(backgroundSyncSaga); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>cancel</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>cancel</strong> effect is used to stop a running background task
  that was started using fork. This is useful when a user navigates away or when
  a task is no longer needed.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> yield cancel(task); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>select</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>select</strong> effect allows a saga to read data from the Redux
  store. It does not modify the state, it only reads the current value.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> const userId = yield select(state => state.user.id); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>delay</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>delay</strong> effect pauses the saga for a specific amount of
  time. It is often used for polling, retry logic, or showing loaders.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> yield delay(1000); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>race</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>race</strong> effect runs multiple effects at the same time and
  continues with the one that finishes first. All other running effects are
  automatically cancelled. This is commonly used to implement timeouts.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code>
    yield race({ response: call(fetchData), timeout: delay(5000), });
  </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>all</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>all</strong> effect is used to run multiple effects in parallel.
  The saga waits until all of them complete before continuing.
</p>

<div class="code-box">
  <code> yield all([ call(fetchUsers), call(fetchPosts), ]); </code>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>Key takeaway</h2>

<p>
  Redux Saga effects make asynchronous logic predictable and easy to control.
  They keep API calls, delays, and background work outside components, making
  the application easier to maintain and test.
